; that if ten child processes fail within a minute, the main php-fpm process
; should restart itself. This might not sound robust, but PHP is a short-lived
; process that does leak memory, so restarting the main process in cases of high
; failure can solve a lot of problems.

; The third option, process_control_timeout, tells the child processes to wait
; for this much time before executing the signal received from the parent process.
;This is useful in cases where the child processes are in the middle of something
;when the parent processes send a KILL signal, for example. With ten seconds on hand,
; theyâ€™ll have a better chance of finishing their tasks and exiting gracefully.
